# Can be omitted to improve performance (and hence DoS attempts) very very slightly at the risk of making it heuristically more likely to accept attempted TCP attacks.

# Validates that the padding at the end of TCP options is zero (empty).

# Validates that the length of known options with a fixed length is correct.

# Validates that source port can not be zero; a zero source port is very rare.

# Validates that source port is not one of the reserved ports.

# tcp-engine

[tcp-engine] is a rust crate.


## Licensing

The license for this project is AGPL3.


## Security and Robustness Features Supported

* Fixed size memory usage for transmission control blocks and related structures at start-up; no dynamic memory allocation per connection;
* Urgent segments are not permitted;
* Non-zero padding and urgent pointers are disallowed;
* TCP known options are always length checked;
* Push flag is always ignored;
* Invalid flag combinations are blackholed;
* Unusual but valid combinations are blackholed;
* Fixed memory usage at start-up;
* Alarm wheels of fixed size with fixed sized 'ticks' to prevent unbounded and unstable alarm growth (memory for alarms is statically allocated at start up);
* SYN flooding defences are permanently on: there is no syncache;
* MSS clamping
    * Connections with a small MSS are refused (usually under 984 on IPv4 and 1220 on IPv6);
    * Connections without a MSS option default to the Path MSS, rather than the TCP minimum;
* ICMP and ICMPv6 messages are completely ignored to make attackers time harder:-
    * There is no Path MTU discovery;
    * Connection failures ignored;
* Invalid packets are blackholed rather than resulting in resets;
* Connection requests to dead ports are blackholed;
* RFC 7323
    * PAWS without fragmentation;
    * Timestamps which are too old;
    * Timestamp rollover;
    * Random timestamp offsets;
* Segments with an URG flag set or non-zero urgent pointer are considered attacks and blackholed;
* RFC 5961: Challenge Acknowledgments for SYN, RST and data injection attacks;
* No header prediction
* Secure initial sequence number generation
* MD5 authenticated segments when required, with different inbound and outbound keys;
    * Connections requiring MD5 are dropped if segments are unauthenticated;
* Incoming packet reuse to minimize memory overhead;
* Hardware checksum support;
* Zero-Window probe defences (we do not zero-window probe forever, but eventually drop the connection)
    * TODO: Consider changing the zero-window probe logic to time-out after 5 seconds, as longer than this usually indicates a severe problem.
* Duplicate TCP options are always rejected
* Padding bytes are always validated to be zero (0x00)
* Simultaneous Open, a TCP mis-feature, is not possible


## Constraints

* After 11 zero-window probes (ie we have sent 11 probes) have been sent in a row, we drop the connection without sending a reset;
* After 11 retransmissions (ie we have sent 12 transmissions) have been sent of the same segment, we drop the connection without sending a reset;
* Retransmissions and Zero-Window probes after the 8th are no-longer backed off
* Retransmissions during the SYN_SENT state have a different back-off profile to the norm (but match FreeBSD).
* Minimum retransmission time-out, and initial retransmission time-out is 128ms, not 1sec.
* Maximum retransmission time-out is just over 65 seconds (512 x 128ms).
* Zero-window probe times match retransmission time-outs.


## Performance

* A recent connections cache is used to record congestion-control data to make new connections more efficient, using the principle of "yesterday's weather".


## Limitations

* The use of syncookies means that very large Ethernet Jumbo frames (those over 9000 bytes) are not effectively used for IPV6 TCP packets.
* Likewise, the use of Ethernet frames over 1500 bytes are not effectively used for IPv4.
* Experimental TCP options are often treated as duplicates as ExID parsing is not implemented.

### Passively Supported RFCs

Implementation of these RFCs is limited to passive parsing and validation of options to make sure they are not being used as an attack vector.

* RFC 6994 Shared Use of Experimental TCP Options[^No validation of `ExID`s is undertaken and duplicate `ExID`s are not detected]
* RFC 5926 Cryptographic Algorithms for the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO)
* RFC 5925 The TCP Authentication Option[^We also validate that the MD5 option is not present when the TCP authentication option is present, and vice versa]
* RFC 5562 Adding Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Capability to TCP's SYN/ACK Packets
* RFC 5482 TCP User Timeout Option[^This option can not be captured using syncookies and so can not be used]
    * In addition, detection of a squatting option used by some CDNs is also supported and distringuished.
* RFC 4782 Quick-Start for TCP and IP[^Recent discoveries have indicated that Quick-Start is vulnerable to attack]
* RFC 4727 Experimental Values In IPv4, IPv6, ICMPv4, ICMPv6, UDP, and TCP Headers


### Non-RFC Documents of Significant Merit

* Processing Incoming Segments. This is a markdown document synthesizing many of the RFCs above in to a readable, and referencable, document. Many places in the code reference numbered sections in the generated PDF.
* [Laminar TCP Draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mathis-tcpm-tcp-laminar-01). Provides a robust explanation of the subtle meanings of the congestion control variables.
* [A Finite State Machine Model of TCP Connections in the Transport Layer", J. Treurniet and J. H. Lefebvre, 2003](http://cradpdf.drdc-rddc.gc.ca/PDFS/unc25/p520460.pdf). Pages 5 & 6 document a revised state model which makes it clear that many segment flag variations aren't appropriate.


### RFC Violations

ICMP messages are explicitly not supported. In the internet at large, they are often blocked, have been frequently used as attack vectors and are not essential to TCP operation. In practice, only ICMP messages relating to PathMTU discovery and host unreachability are of interest. However, both of these can be used to perform Denial-of-Service or 'Slow' attacks, to both servers and clients, and so we do not make use of them.

* RFC 6298 Section 5.7: We choose to use 3 Ã— 128 milliseconds rather than 3 seconds.
* RFC 6298 Section 2.4: We choose a default minimum of 128 milliseconds rather than one second.
* RFC 6298 Section 2.1: We use an initial minimum of 128 milliseconds OR the most recently cached value if available.
* RFC 6093: We blackhole any segments with an `URG` flag bit set.
* RFC 5961 Section 3.2 Page 8: We do not send a 'Challenge ACK' when in the `LISTEN` or `SYN-RECEIVED` state, as to do so may reveal that a syncookie we sent as an initial challenge is **invalid**.
* RFC 5961: We do not implement rate limiting of 'Challenge ACK's as this can be exploited as a side-channel.
* RFC 4821: We take the advice given and additionally enforce a lowest advertised MSS option of 984 for IPv4 and 1220 for IPv6. In the absence of an MSS option, we force the default MSS to these values rather than 536.
* RFC 3360 Section 2.1: We foricbly validate that the reserved field is zero. This seems to be consistent with RFC 4727 Section 7.2: "There are not enough reserved bits to allocate any for experimentation".
* RFC 2675: IPv6 Jumbograms are not supported.
* RFC 1122: We do not support ICMP messages.
* RFC 793: URG and the urgent pointer are not appropriate in the modern internet and are considered threats.
* RFC 793: We blackhole (ignore) any segments with the `ACK` flag bit set in the `LISTEN` or `SYN-RECEIVED` state as these have no legitimate purpose and normally indicate a scan according to pages 5 & 6 of [A Finite State Machine Model of TCP Connections in the Transport Layer", J. Treurniet and J. H. Lefebvre, 2003](http://cradpdf.drdc-rddc.gc.ca/PDFS/unc25/p520460.pdf).
* RFC 793, Page 72: "If the segment acknowledgment is not acceptable, form a reset segment, <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>, and send it". This is violated becase to send a reset is to either reveal to a potential attacker we exist or to inadvertently abort an existing connection because of a spoofed packet.
* RFC 792: We do not support ICMP messages.

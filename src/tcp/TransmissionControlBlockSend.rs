	/// The definition of SND.MAX is equivalent to the definition of 'snd_max' in [Wright, G. R. and W. R. Stevens, TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 2 (The Implementation), Addison Wesley, January 1995]()".

	/// The range of new sequence numbers which may be emitted by a TCP lies between SND.NXT and SND.UNA + SND.WND - 1.

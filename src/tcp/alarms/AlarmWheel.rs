	/// Alarms are added approximately, but will always go off at the `goes_off_in_ticks`.
	///
	/// Internally, if an alarm goes off at a time greater than the number of slots in the alarm wheel, it will be scheduled to go off as far as possible and then be rescheduled; internally, a remainder (in ticks) is kept to deduce when this should be.
	///
	/// The remainder may be compressed; if so, a maximum remainder of 65,535 ticks is possible (just over 2 hours); this caps alarms to (65,535 + 512) ticks x 128 ms tick size => c. just over 2 hours 20 mins.
	///
	/// If more than one alarm is added at the same tick, then the alarm added *later* will go off before the alarm added *earlier*.
	///
	/// `goes_off_in_ticks` is not calculated from 'now' but from whenever `progress()` was last called at. As long as `progress()` is being called frequently, and at least every tick, then this has no impact.
	///
	/// Alarms where `goes_off_in_ticks` is zero are *not* executed immediately but when `progress` is called next (and at least one tick has elapsed) *except* when an alarm was rescheduled and the progress loop has not yet reached 'now'.

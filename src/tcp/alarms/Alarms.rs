	/// After how long a period are keep-alive probes invoked to verify that an idle connection is still alive.
	///
	/// After this time expires, up to `inclusive_maximum_number_of_keep_alive_probes` keep-alive probes are sent every `interval`.
	/// The number sent is tracked in `number_of_keep_alive_probes_sent_once_keep_alive_time_expired`.
	///
	/// If the remote system is still reachable and functioning, it acknowledges the keep-alive probe by sending a response `Acknowledgment` to the keep-alive probe.
	///
	/// Once a response `Acknowledgment` is received:-
	/// * the delay until the next keep-alive transmission is set to `time`.
	/// * the `number_of_keep_alive_probes_sent_once_keep_alive_time_expired` is reset to zero.
	///
	/// On Linux this is the socket option `TCP_KEEPIDLE`.
	/// On Windows this is the registry entry `KeepAliveTime` and defaults to two hours. However, the current alarm logic does not support alarms after 51.2 seconds.
	///
	/// Many modern high-availability systems use much lower values, eg 6 seconds, 5 seconds, etc.
	///
	/// Defaults to ten (10) seconds.
	pub(crate) keep_alive_time: TickDuration,
	
	/// This parameter determines the interval between TCP keep-alive probes until a response is received.
	///
	/// Defaults to one (1) second.

	/// On Linux this is the socket option `TCP_KEEPINTVL`.
	/// On Windows this is the registry entry `KeepAliveInterval`.
	pub(crate) keep_alive_interval: TickDuration,
	
	/// If this number of keep-alive probes have gone unanswered then the connection is dead and should be aborted.
	///
	/// This is an inclusive value.
	///
	/// If set to zero then keep-alive probes are effectively disabled.
	///
	/// On Linux this is the socket option `TCP_KEEPCNT`.
	/// On Windows this is the registry entry `TcpMaxDataRetransmissions`, and the value is shared with regular retransmission logic and defaults to 5.
	///
	/// A typical value is in the range 3 to 10.
	///
	/// Defaults to five (5).

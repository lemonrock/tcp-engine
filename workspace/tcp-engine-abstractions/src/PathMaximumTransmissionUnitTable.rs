/// Represent a table (probably similar to a routing table) of Path Maximum Transmission Unit values.
pub trait PathMaximumTransmissionUnitTable<Address: InternetProtocolAddress>
{
	/// Used specifically when setting TCP maximum segment size option.
	///
	/// Intended to be implemented as a combination of a cache of `PathMTU` and a set of known, fixed values, perhaps implemented using a routing table such as `IpLookupTable` (in the crate `treebitmap`).
	///
	/// A suitable cache is `LeastRecentlyUsedCacheWithExpiry`.
	///
	/// If there is no specific entry in the cache, an implementation can use `Address::DefaultPathMaximumTransmissionUnitSize`.
	///
	/// Note also the advice of RFC 2923 Section 2.3: "The MSS should be determined based on the MTUs of the interfaces on the system".

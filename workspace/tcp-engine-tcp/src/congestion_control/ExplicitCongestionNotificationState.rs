	/// Window probe packets do not contain any user data except for the sequence number, which is a byte.
	/// If a window probe packet is dropped in the network, this loss is not detected by the receiver.
	/// Therefore, the TCP data sender MUST NOT set either an ECT codepoint or the CWR bit on window probe packets.

	///
	/// RFC 3168 Section 6.1.2 Paragraph 5: "If the new data packet carrying the CWR flag is dropped, then the TCP sender will have to again reduce its congestion window, and send another new data packet with the CWR flag set.

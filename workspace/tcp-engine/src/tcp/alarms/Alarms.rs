	/// The number sent is tracked in `number_of_keep_alive_probes_sent_once_keep_alive_time_expired`.
	///
	/// If the remote system is still reachable and functioning, it acknowledges the keep-alive probe by sending a response `Acknowledgment` to the keep-alive probe.

	/// * the delay until the next keep-alive transmission is set to `time`.

	/// On Windows this is the registry entry `KeepAliveTime` and defaults to two hours. However, the current alarm logic does not support alarms after 51.2 seconds.

	/// On Linux this is the socket option `TCP_KEEPCNT`.
	/// On Windows this is the registry entry `TcpMaxDataRetransmissions`, and the value is shared with regular retransmission logic and defaults to 5.
